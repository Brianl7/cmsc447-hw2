How to run:
    1) You may need to activate the virtual environment in order to run this program. If so, follow these steps:
        1a) If on Windows:
            - in the terminal, type cd hw2_env, followed by Scripts\activate
        1b) If on Linux:
            - in the terminal, type source hw2_env/bin/activate
    2) In the terminal, type 'python app.py'
    3) Then, navigate to your localhost. This should pop up in the terminal, but if not, it should be http://127.0.0.1:5000 (at least, it was for me)
